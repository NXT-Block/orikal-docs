# Vision

**Orikal** is designed to reshape how companies handle idle treasury by offering a secure, transparent, and high-performance staking gateway.

## 🌍 What We Believe
- Treasury capital should be productive without compromising security.
- Web3 offers powerful tools for yield, but they must be accessible and risk-aware.
- Simplicity, transparency, and compliance must go hand-in-hand.

## 🎯 Mission
Enable any company, regardless of its Web3 expertise, to:
- Discover vetted staking opportunities.
- Track performance and risk exposure in real-time.
- Optimize treasury deployment while keeping full control.

## 🔭 Long-Term Vision
- Build the best treasury-focused staking dashboard in Web3.
- Develop an internal risk engine mixing on-chain and off-chain metrics.
- Partner with staking providers and institutional custodians.
- Bridge Web2 and Web3 finance securely.

## 🧱 Foundation Principles
- Security-first: from smart contracts to APIs.
- Multi-chain compatible.
- Self-custody friendly: we never hold client funds.
